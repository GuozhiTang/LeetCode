 * Testcase Example:  '[2,5]\n4'
 *
 * You have an inventory of different colored balls, and there is a customer
 * that wants orders balls of any color.
 * 
 * The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is
 * the number of balls of that colorÂ you currently have in your inventory. For
 * example, if you own 6 yellow balls, the customer would pay 6 for the first
 * yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only 5 yellow balls left, so
 * the next yellow ball is then valued at 5 (i.e., the value of the balls
 * decreases as you sell more to the customer).
 * 
 * You are given an integer array, inventory, where inventory[i] represents the
 * number of balls of the i^th color that you initially own. You are also given
 * an integer orders, which represents the total number of balls that the
 * customer wants. You can sell the balls in any order.
 * 
 * Return the maximum total value that you can attain after selling orders
 * colored balls. As the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: inventory = [2,5], orders = 4
 * Output: 14
 * Explanation: Sell the 1st color 1 time (2) and the 2nd color 3 times (5 + 4
 * + 3).
 * The maximum total value is 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 14.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: inventory = [3,5], orders = 6
 * Output: 19
 * Explanation: Sell the 1st color 2 times (3 + 2) and the 2nd color 4 times (5
 * + 4 + 3 + 2).
 * The maximum total value is 3 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 19.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= inventory.length <= 10^5
 * 1 <= inventory[i] <= 10^9
 * 1 <= orders <= min(sum(inventory[i]), 10^9)
 * 
 *
