Here are all the attempts, practice and explanations I did for solving the problems on LeetCode.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
cd
### Prerequisites

* We can directly test these code with corresponding questions on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

* If locally test is demanded, then Java must be installed ahead of time: 
    * The steps of installing Java in Windows or MacOS can be found in my repository "Guozhi_Programming_Notes": [Java Environment Settings](https://app.gitbook.com/@tangguozhi53/s/guozhi-programming-notes/configuration-tutorials/1.1-java-environment-settings)

### Imports

* An external package must be imported into the project: 
    * Name: `minimal-json-0.9.5.jar`
    * Path: In my repository [Library/json](https://github.com/GuozhiTang/Library/tree/master/Json)


## Running the project

* We can directly copy and run the project in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) IDE.

* Or we can run the code directly in our local IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA.

## Built With

* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) - The main Object-oriented language for me to solve the problems.
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - Useful Java Integrated Development Environment.
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) - The main platform for practice.
