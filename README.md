Here is the new round of LeetCode practices.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* If locally test is demanded, then Java must be installed ahead of time: 
    * The steps of installing Java in Windows or MacOS can be found in my repository "Guozhi_Programming_Notes": [Java Environment Settings](https://app.gitbook.com/@tangguozhi53/s/guozhi-programming-notes/configuration-tutorials/1.1-java-environment-settings)


## Running the project

* We can directly copy and run the project in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) IDE.

* Or we can run the code directly in our local IDE, such as Visual Studio Code.

## Built With

* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) - The main Object-oriented language for me to solve the problems.
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) - The main platform for practice.
